Project Awesome UI and Backend based on node.js on Heroku

# Getting Started

To get started with this code, you need to set up a few things first.  This list may not be complete; we'll add to it, as we discover things that are missing.

At a minimum, you'll need to set up your development environment with:
* The Heroku toolbelt for working with Node.js (follow the tutorial at heroku.com)
 * This includes, at least, git, node, and npm
* For running and testing locally, you'll also need Postgres.  See: http://www.postgresql.org/download/

After forking the repo, you need to run `npm install` from the root directory.  This will install various node.js modules as specified in package.json.  This includes, among other things:

* mocha, which is a test framework for node
* passport, which is used for authenticating against Facebook, Google, etc. for logins
* sequelize, which provides a database abstraction layer

To be able to run tests locally, you may also need to do:

```
sudo npm install mocha -g
```

To see if that worked, try typing `mocha` at the command line.  You should see something like this:

```
169-231-89-105:awesome-ui-backend-node-heroku pconrad$ mocha


  0 passing (3ms)

169-231-89-105:awesome-ui-backend-node-heroku pconrad$ 
```


# Setting up your environment variables

Define:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@localhost/postgres
```

# A bit of Postgres 

* `psql` is the command to get into the postgres command line
* `\l` lists databases
